This project demonstrates the automation of cloud infrastructure setup, configuration management, container deployment, and CI/CD integration using modern DevOps tools. The objective is to host a sample web application on an AWS EC2 instance by integrating Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.
The entire workflow eliminates manual effort and ensures faster, more reliable deployments with consistent infrastructure. The deliverables include Terraform scripts, Ansible playbooks, a Dockerized web form application, and a CI/CD pipeline configuration that automates deployment when new code is pushed.
